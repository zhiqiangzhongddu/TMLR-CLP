# Compatible Label Propagation

### Required packages
The code has been tested running under Python 3.7.3. with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):

- numpy == 1.16.5
- pandas == 0.25.1
- scikit-learn == 0.21.2
- networkx == 2.3
- community == 0.13
- pytorch == 1.1.0
- torch_geometric == 1.3.2

### Data requirement
All eight datasets we used in the paper are all public datasets which can be downloaded from the internet.

### Code execution
Two demo file is given to show the execution of CLP. 
Many optional hyper-parameters to try with, such as alpha, echo-free propagation mechanism, etc.
