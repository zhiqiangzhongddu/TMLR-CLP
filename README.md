- torch_geometric == 1.3.2

### Data requirement
All eight datasets we used in the paper are all public datasets which can be downloaded from the internet.

### Code execution
Two demo file is given to show the execution of CLP. 
Many optional hyper-parameters to try with, such as alpha, echo-free propagation mechanism, etc.
